### 📱 Headline Summary (Tweet-length)  
Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians remain stranded along the 817 km Thai border six weeks after a fragile ceasefire. Thailand’s nationalist Thai Sovereignty Party victory raises fears of renewed fighting over Preah Vihear temple, intensifying a looming humanitarian crisis.  

### 📋 Executive Summary  
Six weeks on from the bloodiest Cambodia–Thailand clashes in over a decade, an estimated 350,000 civilians on both sides remain displaced along the 817 km frontier near the disputed Preah Vihear temple. A ceasefire brokered on Dec. 27, 2025, returned forces to pre-1990 positions, but sporadic skirmishes and landmine incidents persist. Thailand’s Feb. 9 general election delivered a landslide win to the nationalist Thai Sovereignty Party, whose leader Chaiyaphum Worakan has vowed to recapture contested territory. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has urged the incoming Thai government to honour the UN-backed agreement and the 1962 ICJ ruling that largely favours Cambodia’s claim. Meanwhile, overcrowded displacement camps in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province lack sanitation, heightening the risk of disease. Aid agencies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, warn that sustained access and funding are critical to averting a full-blown humanitarian emergency.  

### 📖 Comprehensive Summary  
The clashes between Cambodian and Thai forces over the Preah Vihear temple region—an area of longstanding contention—erupted in late May 2025, resulting in at least 149 fatalities and displacing some 350,000 civilians on both sides of the 817 km border. Under a UN-mediated ceasefire sealed on Dec. 27, 2025, both armies agreed to revert to pre-1990 positions. However, small-scale firing, artillery exchanges and landmine incidents have continued, leaving thousands in a state of perpetual insecurity.

The Feb. 9, 2026, Thai general election saw the ultranationalist Thai Sovereignty Party secure a commanding victory. Party leader Chaiyaphum Worakan made retaking disputed areas a central plank, declaring, “We will not allow foreign troops to threaten our sovereignty. We will defend our land.” Analysts warn that such rhetoric could prompt fresh incursions or larger-scale operations, undermining the ceasefire and international legal frameworks.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who succeeded his father Hun Sen last year, has appealed for de-escalation, invoking the International Court of Justice’s 1962 judgment that largely upheld Cambodia’s claim to the Preah Vihear ridge. “In the spirit of peace and good neighbourliness, we expect our Thai friends to uphold the agreement reached at the UN-backed talks,” he said in Phnom Penh. Yet, with domestic pressure mounting in Bangkok from military hardliners, diplomatic caution may collide with nationalist fervour.

In Cambodia’s northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, makeshift camps crowd tens of thousands of displaced families into tents and rudimentary shelters. Facilities lack clean water, latrines and basic medical services. Michelle Tan of the International Committee of the Red Cross warns of outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections if aid access and funding do not improve. “This is not just a border dispute; it’s a human tragedy,” she said, stressing the need for sustained humanitarian corridors.

Experts note that the Preah Vihear conflict is as much about national pride as it is about strategic high ground. The temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site perched on a cliff, symbolizes sovereignty and cultural identity for both nations. Past flare-ups in the late 2000s led to similar displacement and international mediation, but without a long-term peacebuilding mechanism.

Looking ahead, regional stability hinges on Thailand’s new administration anchoring its border policy in multilateral frameworks rather than unilateral military action. Confidence-building measures—joint border patrols, demining initiatives and cross-border trade facilitation—could reduce the risk of accidental clashes. For Cambodia, sustaining ceasefire monitoring and preserving civilian morale in displacement camps will be equally urgent. Unless both capitals combine diplomatic restraint with humanitarian commitment, the fragile calm could shatter, reigniting a conflict with wider geopolitical repercussions in Southeast Asia.
