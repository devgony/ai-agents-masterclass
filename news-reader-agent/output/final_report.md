## Executive Summary  
A fragile ceasefire brokered on Dec. 27, 2025, between Cambodian and Thai forces near the disputed Preah Vihear temple has held at the macro level, but local skirmishes and landmine incidents continue to imperil civilians. With Thailand’s nationalist Thai Sovereignty Party sweeping the Feb. 9 general election on a pledge to “defend our land,” analysts warn of renewed military pressure on Cambodia’s border. Some 350,000 people remain displaced in overcrowded camps in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province, where inadequate sanitation and medical services risk a full-blown humanitarian emergency.

## 🚨 Today's Lead Story  
### Thai Nationalists’ Victory Raises Stakes for Cambodia Border Peace  
Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians remain stranded along the 817 km frontier six weeks after the bloodiest clash in more than a decade ended in a UN-brokered ceasefire. The Feb. 9 triumph of the ultranationalist Thai Sovereignty Party, whose leader vows to recapture contested Preah Vihear territory, threatens to upend the fragile calm. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has appealed to his Thai counterparts to honour both the ceasefire and the 1962 ICJ ruling that largely favours Cambodia’s claim. Meanwhile, displacement camps in Banteay Meanchey province are bursting at the seams, lacking clean water, latrines and basic health facilities. Aid agencies warn that without sustained access and funding, the situation could tip into a humanitarian catastrophe.

## 🎯 Editor's Analysis  
**Key Themes Today:**  
- Nationalist politics driving border dispute rhetoric  
- Humanitarian fallout of protracted ceasefire insecurity  

**What This Means:**  
Thailand’s incoming ultranationalist administration faces a choice: pursue hard-line border operations or adhere to international legal frameworks and the UN-backed ceasefire. Cambodia, for its part, must marshal both diplomatic pressure and humanitarian resources to prevent the crisis from deepening.  

**Looking Ahead:**  
- Will joint demining and patrol initiatives be revived under new Thai leadership?  
- Can international donors secure funding and access to stave off disease outbreaks in displacement camps?
