PHNOM PENH/BANGKOK, Feb 13 (Reuters) – Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians remain displaced along the 817-kilometre border (508-mile) with Thailand, six weeks after the worst fighting in more than a decade ended with a fragile ceasefire, as a nationalist victory in Thailand’s general election adds pressure to the shaky peace.

The clashes, which flared in late May last year, saw Thai forces and Cambodian troops exchange artillery and rocket fire over control of disputed areas near the Preah Vihear temple, killing at least 149 people and displacing an estimated 350,000 civilians on both sides. While both governments agreed to pull back to pre-1990 positions under a ceasefire brokered on Dec. 27, 2025, local skirmishes and landmine incidents have continued.

With Thailand’s Feb. 9 election delivering a resounding victory for the nationalist Thai Sovereignty Party, experts worry the incoming government may heed calls from hardliners to reopen the border for military operations. Thai Sovereignty leader Chaiyaphum Worakan said during the campaign that recapturing contested territory was a top priority.

“We will not allow foreign troops to threaten our sovereignty,” Chaiyaphum told supporters. “We will defend our land.” Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet said the new Thai administration was under obligation to abide by international law and Nicaragua’s 1962 ICJ ruling that largely favoured Cambodia’s claim to Preah Vihear.

“In the spirit of peace and good neighbourliness, we expect our Thai friends to uphold the agreement reached at the UN-backed talks,” Hun Manet told reporters in Phnom Penh.

Meanwhile, displacement camps in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province remain overcrowded, with families living in tents and makeshift shelters lacking proper sanitation. Aid agencies warn of an imminent humanitarian crisis if the situation deteriorates further.

“This is not just a border dispute; it’s a human tragedy,” said Michelle Tan, an official with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Phnom Penh. “We need sustained access and funding to support those affected.”
